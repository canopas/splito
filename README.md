## Project Setup ⚙️

Make sure you have the latest stable version of Xcode installed. Then, you can clone this repository to Xcode.

### Notes 📝 
- If you're contributing to the project, make sure to create your own Firebase project and follow the steps above to configure the required files.
- Ensure that you update the `GoogleService-Info.plist` and `Secrets.xcconfig` file with your own Firebase project values to build and run the app successfully.
- Sensitive data such as `REVERSE_CLIENT_ID` and other keys are not included in the repository for security purposes.

To clone and run the Splito project locally, please follow these steps:

### 1. Requirements ✅
- **Xcode:** Version 15.4 or higher.
- **iOS:** Version 16.4 or higher.
- **Firebase:** A Firebase project set up in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

### 2. Creating the Config Settings File 🛠️
- Create a `Secrets.xcconfig` File.
- Add the following configuration values to a new file named `Secrets.xcconfig` in the Splito directory:

```
// APP INFO
app_name = Splito
app_bundle = com.*****.splito // as per your choice.
app_version_name = 1.0.0
app_version_code = 1000000
```

### 3. Firebase Setup 🚀

- **Create a Firebase Project:**
  - Go to the Firebase Console.
  - Create a new project and configure it with the same bundle ID used in the project.

- **Enable Firebase Services:**
  - Authentication (Phone, Google, and Apple login).
  - Firestore (For storing user data).
 
- **Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`:**
  - After setting up Firebase, download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from the Firebase Console.
  - Add this file to the project directory under `Splito/Plist/GoogleService-Info.plist`.

### 4. Configuring Reverse Client ID 🔑

- **Set Up Google Login:**
  - Obtain the `REVERSE_CLIENT_ID` from your Firebase project's Google Sign-In setup.
  - Add this value to the `Secrets.xcconfig` file in the following format:

```
  GOOGLE_REVERSE_CLIENT_ID = com.googleusercontent.apps.************-********.....
```

- **Reference in `Info.plist`:**
  - The project is configured to use environment variables for sensitive data.
  - The `REVERSE_CLIENT_ID` is dynamically added to `Info.plist` during the build process.

### 5. Environment Variable for Deployment 🌐
- The `Secrets.xcconfig` file and `GoogleService-Info.plist` are base64-encoded and stored securely in GitHub secrets for CI/CD purposes.
- During deployment, these files are decoded and added to the project.
- For more detail, you can check this [deployment script](https://github.com/canopas/splito/blob/main/.github/workflows/Deploy.yml).
